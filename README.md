# aquabrowser
Super simple, basic .NET browser with blazing fast speeds. All DLLs included in EXE.

# Please note:
Future, more feature-rich version will become avalible as a **proprietary** system. You will have to get your *free* license key for the base version, and possibly a tipping jar effort for future development.

# Features coming in next version:
- Tabs
- HTML5 Feature-rich Support
- Moving to Chromium instead of .NET (this build is merely a proof of concept)
- Integrated Tor and privacy respecting features, as is the main goal of Aqua

# Have a lovely day!
